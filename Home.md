# Lisk Wiki

Lisk Wiki aims to write down all the knowledge which is spread
in the heads of Lisk community members. This knowledge should be
searchable and cloneable, released under a free license.

## Whats the difference to the Lisk documentation?

1. This wiki is not complete and will never be. It has no start, no end
and no order.
Individual pages are pieces of information that should help people searching
for specific information.
2. This wiki is crowd sourced. Feel free to fix and extend articles or create
entire pages using pull requests.
3. Content in this wiki is released under a free license that allows everyone
to share and reuse content.

## Contributing

The best start is to check the existing pages and see if you can improve them. This gets you a good idea of what this is all about. If you can provide content for new pages, you can add them as well.

<<GlobalTOC("All pages")>>

All contributions are done using [pull requests on Github](https://github.com/prolina-foundation/lisk-wiki).
You can preview your changes by checking out your fork locally and running `gollum` in the repository root. Then your local changes can be previewed at http://localhost:4567/ in the browser.

**Every typo is worth fixing!** We encourage you to strive for perfection. We happily accept contributions that fix grammar or only change a single character if that improves the readability for our users.
